# Interviewer
## This is a simple program that i was trying to develop trying to get a series of random questions popped into the the CLI

It is an app that i want to use and work on that will allow the use of a pseudo-random algorithm to permit the flow of a series of a questions to imitate the randomness of a job interview. The code is up to date in this site, and i tried to upload and display the images of a glitch running to the CL program. in GitHub but i do not know MarkDown that well so hopefully you are able to see it as a link to dropbox. 

#### So it seems to me that in my attempt to have a randomness i made have tried to experiment with an imitation of Ai. 

I tried using recursivism  and the random method of python to keep the randomness of the program. But i keep getting the problem i showed you in the first screen capture/link. That is i run into questions repeating again and again multiple times. The issue it seems to be is that i am recalling the same function through several iterations and so it resets the variable list that i am calling back into.
